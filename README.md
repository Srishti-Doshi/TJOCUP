# Joy of Computing Using Python  
### *Inspired by the NPTEL course by Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar, IIT Ropar*

This repository contains my learning, practice programs, and implementations based on the **“Joy of Computing Using Python”** course.  
The aim is to build strong logical thinking and apply Python to solve real-world and fun computational problems.

## ───────── About the Course ─────────

**The Joy of Computing Using Python** is a fun and insightful introduction to programming.  
It uses simple stories, analogies, and real-life examples to convert:

- **Abstractions → Insights**  
- **Engineering → Art**  
- **Beginners → Logical Thinkers**

The course encourages logical thinking and helps you approach problems programmatically.  
You don’t just learn Python — you learn how to think like a computer scientist.
