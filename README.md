#  Joy of Computing Using Python  
### *Inspired by the NPTEL course by Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar, IIT Ropar*

This repository contains my learning, practice programs, and implementations based on the **“Joy of Computing Using Python”** course.  
The aim is to build strong logical thinking and apply Python to solve real-world and fun computational problems.

## 🎯 About the Course

**The Joy of Computing Using Python** is not just a programming course —  
it is a whirlwind tour of logic, curiosity, and computational joy.

Designed with anecdotes, analogies, and lively examples, the course transforms:

- **Abstractions → Insights**  
- **Engineering → Art**  
- **Beginners → Logical Thinkers**

Using Python as the medium, the course trains you to think programmatically and solve problems elegantly.  
By the end, you don't just learn Python — you learn how to think like a computer scientist.
